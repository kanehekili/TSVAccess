building:
create build package
copy the resources
pip install --target=libs -r /path/to/requirements.txt
modify - if necessary:
    sys.path.insert(0, "libs")  # Add the "libs" folder to the Python path
    
package it. 

A base requirements.txt is @ resources
generate requirements with pip freeze > req.txt

Major update will force a library update:

rm-rf libs/
pip install --target=libs -r requirements.txt

Each app needs a req.txt for later easy update.
