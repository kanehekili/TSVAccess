From a point of a unix/linux user this shows how sick windows is. Following an attempt how to install the RegisterModule on an alien windows system:

Install python from
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.4/python-3.11.4-amd64.exe
install python as custom for all users and pip, no doku, debug etc
mkdir C:\Users\<user>\Access

pip install PyQt5 opencv-python mysql-connector-python paramiko
 extract the contents of TsvWinReg.zip into (e.g.) C:\Users\<user>\Access
 rename the TsvRegistration.py into ..pyw.
 Use the Windoze file explorer - find somehow the user dir - click the pyw file and create a shortcut via Context menu .
 Select the favicon in web/static as icon.
